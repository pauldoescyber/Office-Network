# Office-network.
This is an office network topology built on Cisco packet tracer to mimic an office network enviroment. 
# Project Description.
Here I built an office network on cisco pakcet tracer consisting of two departments each under two different networks(sales and IT), a web server on its own network and a DNS server that would resolve the name of the website hosted by the web server(www.myoffice.com). The router (router0) has been configured for DHCP and hence assigned IP addressed dynamically to the hosts on the two office networks..that is the sales(192.168.1.0) and IT(192.168.2.0)department.
